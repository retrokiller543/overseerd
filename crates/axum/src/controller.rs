//! Controllers: the HTTP-facing services, and how they register their routes.
//!
//! A controller is a DI singleton (like an RPC service) annotated with `#[controller]`. Its
//! `#[handlers]` impl blocks contribute routes. The macro emits a [`ControllerDescriptor`]
//! into the [`CONTROLLERS`] slice and an implementation of [`Controller`]; the
//! [`Axum`](crate::Axum) folds the slice on `auto_discover` and merges each
//! controller's [`axum::Router`] when the protocol is built.
