//! [`Publisher<T>`]: the typed, injected publish surface.
//!
//! A handler takes `Inject<Publisher<ChatTopics>>` and calls `publish(ChatTopics::Room(msg))`. The
//! destination and body come from the [`Topic`] value itself, so a wrong payload type for a topic
//! is a compile error, not a runtime mismatch. `Publisher<T>` is not a seeded component — it is a
//! [`FromContainer`] that resolves the shared [`TopicBus`](super::TopicBus) for the topic set's
//! protocol (`T::Protocol`), so it works from both message handlers and ordinary HTTP handlers
//! without a per-`T` descriptor.
