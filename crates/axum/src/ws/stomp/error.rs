//! STOMP-specific failures, distinct from the framing-agnostic [`WsDispatchError`].
//!
//! A [`StompError`] is what can go wrong *speaking* STOMP on a connection — a malformed frame, a
//! missing required header, no common protocol version — as opposed to dispatching a decoded
//! message to a handler (that stays [`WsDispatchError`]). It renders to an `ERROR` frame via the
//! server module's `error_frame` helper before the socket closes.
