//! # Components: two ways to provide one
//!
//! A *component* is a singleton dependency, resolved by type. There are two ways
//! to get one into the daemon's container:
//!
//! 1. **System-constructed** — annotate the type with `#[component]` (or use the selected
//!    protocol's component-producing macro). The macro registers a factory; the container builds
//!    the instance from its dependencies during startup.
//! 2. **Manually provided** — construct the instance yourself and hand it to
//!    `AppBuilder::with_component`. Annotate the type
//!    `#[component(default_factory = false)]`, which emits the `Component` metadata
//!    with no factory.
//!
//! Both forms register a descriptor in the `DescriptorRegistry`; the difference
//! is whether the descriptor carries a factory or expects a provided instance.
//!
//! # Field injection
//!
//! `#[component]` and `#[service]` build their factory by *field injection*. For
//! each field of the struct:
//!
//! - an `Arc<T>` field is treated as a **dependency** and resolved from the
//!   container (`cx.resolve::<T>()`);
//! - a `Cfg<T>` field carrying `#[config("path")]` is a **config binding** resolved
//!   by property path (omit the path for the sole-binding shorthand);
//! - a `#[default]` field is **owned state**, built with `Default::default()` — so
//!   its type must implement `Default`, otherwise construct the component another
//!   way (an `#[init]` constructor, or `with_component`).
//!
//! # Implementation
//!
//! Each `#[proc_macro_*]` entry point here is a thin shim: it forwards its token streams to
//! the matching `expand` function in [`upwell_macros_core`], the ordinary library that
//! holds all the parsing and codegen (a proc-macro crate can only export proc-macros, so the
//! reusable machinery lives there). Errors are surfaced as `compile_error!` by the core, not
//! by panicking.

/// Declares a **system-constructed singleton component** on a struct.
///
/// The container builds the instance during startup by *field injection*: each
/// field is resolved from the container as a dependency (its type is an injectable
/// handle — `Arc<T>`, `Cfg<T>` for config, a trait-object collection, …), unless it
/// carries `#[default]`, which makes it owned state built with `Default::default()`.
/// Use this for dependencies the system can assemble itself (pools, clients composed
/// from other components, …). For an instance you must build yourself, use
/// `#[component(default_factory = false)]` and provide it via
/// `AppBuilder::with_component`.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// All optional:
/// - `id` — unique component id. Defaults to the lowercased type name.
/// - `name` — display name. Defaults to the type name.
/// - `factory = path` — register `path` (an async `Factory`) as the constructor
///   instead of field injection; its parameters are its dependencies.
/// - `default_factory = false` — emit no factory (a **manual** instance, provided
///   via `AppBuilder::with_component`).
/// - `factory_slice = Ident` — override the generated `{Type}Factories` slice name.
/// - `priority = <const i64 expression>` — collection-provider order among providers whose
///   `before` / `after` constraints are satisfied; lower values run first. Constants and
///   associated constants are accepted.
/// - `before` / `after` — relative ordering constraints for traits shared by both providers;
///   use `as dyn Trait` to require and restrict the relationship to a specific trait.

/// #[component(factory = Db::connect)]   // explicit async factory
/// #[component(default_factory = false)] // manual, via with_component
/// ```
///
/// # What it generates
///
/// - `impl Component for T` (carrying `ID`/`NAME`);
/// - a `ComponentDescriptor` registered into the `COMPONENTS` slice (picked up by
///   `auto_discover`), pointing at the type's `{Type}Factories` slice — which holds
///   the field-injection default (unless suppressed) plus any `factory =` / `#[init]`
///   entry.

/// # Errors
///

/// | `cli` | reserved-slot block | Customizes framework-owned Clap arguments and the generated serve command. |
/// | `args` | `{ field: Type, ... }` | Flattens application-owned global `clap::Args` groups. |

/// ```toml
/// clap = { version = "4", features = ["derive"] }
/// ```
///
/// `HostCli` has one flattened public `bootstrap: HostBootstrapArgs`, one public flattened field for

/// and generate PascalCase Rust variants. A namespace creates a public enum named by its full path
/// and contains its own single subcommand field. Empty command blocks/namespaces, normalized or Rust
/// variant collisions, framework-reserved names/options, and names beginning `__upwell` are
/// rejected.
///
/// Command entries accept doc attributes and a deliberately bounded set of non-structural Clap
/// `#[command(...)]` settings: help/version/display metadata, aliases and command flags, help
/// layout/styling, usage text, and local parser behavior. The
/// [complete allowlist is maintained beside the parser](https://github.com/upwell-rs/upwell/blob/main/crates/macros-core/src/app/command.rs#L315-L427).
/// `name`, `ignore_errors`, `rename_all`, `rename_all_env`, `flatten`, `subcommand`,
/// `external_subcommand`, `skip`, `allow_external_subcommands`, and `subcommand_required` are
/// explicitly rejected because they can replace or bypass generated typed dispatch; settings
/// outside the allowlist are also rejected.
///
/// Leaf types implement `clap::Args + CliCommand<Host>` and select exactly one sealed phase:
/// `Setup`, `PreBuild`, or `Built`. Every `CommandContext` exposes `bootstrap()`,
/// `bootstrap_mut()`, and `require::<T>()`; `PreBuild` adds `prepared()`, while `Built` adds `app()`
/// and async `resolve::<T>()`. This makes invalid stage access a compile-time error. Command errors
/// are returned as `CliError::Command` with the complete normalized command path.
///
/// # Static plugins
///
/// `plugins: [PluginType]` installs an application plugin. `replace SLOT => ReplacementType`
/// replaces a protocol-owned replaceable default slot, and `suppress SLOT` removes a
/// protocol-owned optional default slot. Installed and replacement types must implement
/// `Plugin + Default`; construction is synchronous (`P::default()`), occurs before parser
/// composition, and the same retained instance contributes CLI facets and is consumed during
/// preparation. Plugin constructors are not async.
///
/// Slot constants belong to protocol crates. Replacement/suppression fails for unknown, mandatory,
/// wrong-policy, duplicate, or conflicting slots. The built-in RPC and Axum protocols currently
/// declare no default plugin slots, so their applications can install plugins but have no built-in
/// slot constant to replace or suppress. Protocol authors expose their own namespaced
/// `PluginSlotId` constants when they add defaults.
///
/// A plugin's `Plugin::cli` may register `args::<T>(ContributionId)`, one named
/// `command::<T>(ContributionId, name)`, or a flattened native
/// `commands::<T>(ContributionId)`. Stable provider IDs and the fully composed parser are checked
/// for collisions across framework, application, and plugin ownership. Plugin commands implement
/// `PluginCliCommand` and receive protocol-neutral `PluginCommandContext<Setup | PreBuild | Built>`.
/// Setup exposes bootstrap values; pre-build adds application name, registry, and plugin plan;
/// built adds application name, plugin plan, and DI resolution, but deliberately not a concrete
/// protocol app.
///
/// Plugins added later in `configure`, `before_build`, or direct builder code through
/// `register_plugin::<T>()`, `register_plugin_with_options::<T>(options)`, or
/// `with_plugin(instance)` participate only in runtime preparation. They cannot change the parser
/// or replace/suppress the already resolved early catalog.
///
/// # Tooling
///
/// With `tooling`, each named app gets a target-local `#[doc(hidden)] tooling_probe(target)` seam.
/// With `cli + tooling`, `run()` also recognizes exactly one private process invocation containing
/// only `--__upwell-tooling-probe-v1`; this is not an end-user command. Tooling requires a
/// literal `name` even when CLI generation is disabled.
///
/// The probe resolves static protocol/application plugins, composes and validates the effective
/// Clap parser when `cli` is present, parses only generated bootstrap defaults, runs bootstrap in
/// `ExecutionMode::Tooling`, then runs `setup`, `configure`, `before_build`, and
/// `AppBuilder::prepare`. It projects that exact immutable `PreparedApp` into a deterministic,
/// versioned tooling document. CLI metadata is derived from the final executable Clap tree after
/// plugin augmentation, including displayed names, aliases, defaults, cardinality, global flags,
/// command nesting, canonical framework IDs, and framework/application/plugin ownership. Without
/// `cli`, the tooling document has no CLI section.
///
/// The probe does not build ordinary components, the root container, `AppRuntime`, or the protocol
/// runtime; it does not run `after_build` or `serve`, open listeners, run startup hooks, start config
/// watchers, or wait for shutdown. Static plugin instances are still synchronously constructed and
/// consumed because their parser and prepared-plan contributions are being inspected. Application
/// callbacks are application code, so guard side effects with `context.mode().is_run()`.
///
/// The callable seam catches unwind and returns a stable envelope but cannot replace an embedding
/// process's panic hook. The dedicated process path installs a payload-free hook. At the user-facing
/// #152 boundary, Cargo tooling, not `app!`, selects one package and binary target, builds and invokes
/// it, supplies target identity and a private response directory, and validates the atomically
/// published, no-clobber envelope. The private directory provides isolation and stale temporary
/// cleanup, not publication correctness. Stdout/stderr remain separate. There is no process-global
/// app registry and tooling does not parse source or infer a binary from a compile-time crate name.
///
/// Protocols and plugins may add validated owner-scoped resources, labels, relationships, and
/// namespaced versioned JSON facets from prepared descriptors. Projection reads retained prepared
/// metadata; it does not reconstruct metadata by building runtime objects.
///
/// # Feature behavior
///
/// | Feature | Present | Absent |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | `cli` *(default)* | Generates Clap types, bootstrap, command dispatch, `run`, and `run_with`; requires direct Clap. | Generates only typestate lifecycle/builder APIs; no parser or `CliCommand` surface. |
/// | `tooling` | Generates the callable/private process probe and prepared-plan projection. | No probe entry or tooling document projection from the host. |
/// | `di-check` *(facade default)* | `services` emits `Wired` assertions and component macros emit compile-time provider bounds. | Runtime preparation still validates the effective graph; `services` has no effect. |
/// | `watch` | Config managers can start requested file watchers. | `watch: true` remains a valid manager request but is logged and ignored at startup. |
/// | `tracing-subscriber` | Generated bootstrap can accept setup-contributed layers and install the resolved global subscriber after setup. | Logging/color policy is still resolved, but generated bootstrap does not install a subscriber and layer APIs are absent. |
/// | `hybrid-registry` | Forces generated metadata registration through `inventory`. | Uses `linkme`, except Apple/Mach-O hosts automatically select `inventory`; cross-compiling to Mach-O should force this feature. |
///
/// `tooling` is independent of `cli`; CLI metadata exists only when both are enabled. `watch`,
/// `tracing-subscriber`, and `hybrid-registry` are facade-level features forwarded to the relevant
/// core/macro crates and do not select a protocol.
///
/// # Errors and escape hatches
///
/// Syntax errors are source-local `compile_error!` diagnostics: unknown/duplicate keys, invalid
/// manager or lifecycle grammar, reserved CLI collisions, invalid default shapes, unsupported
/// command attributes, empty namespaces, and malformed plugin directives point at the offending
/// declaration token or block rather than the whole macro invocation. User-provided application,
/// protocol, callback, manager, plugin, argument, command, and path tokens are reused directly in
/// generated Rust. DSL keys that correspond to generated Rust declarations are each mapped to one
/// principal declaration; differently spelled declarations retain generated resolution while using
/// the source key's location. This semantic mapping is best effort through stable proc-macro spans:
/// rust-analyzer highlighting, hover, and go-to-definition depend on the analyzer and toolchain's
/// span support and are not guaranteed. Other synthesized items are anchored to the nearest
/// application, namespace, or command identifier. Compiler diagnostics involving directly reused
/// user tokens remain source-local.
/// Rust then reports type-level errors at generated uses: wrong protocol/extension types,
/// inaccessible public command types, invalid Clap defaults, non-`Injectable` serve dependencies,
/// callback contract mismatches, and `Wired` failures.
///
/// At runtime, `builder()` returns config-loading errors. `run_with` distinguishes plugin-catalog,
/// parser-definition, Clap, bootstrap, phase-tagged lifecycle, and command failures through
/// `CliError`; direct lifecycle methods return `PhaseError`, whose `phase()` identifies the failed
/// boundary. Preparation reports config, plugin composition, descriptor/provider, dependency,
/// scope, and protocol validation errors before ordinary construction. Tooling rejects any build
/// transition before construction begins.
///
/// Use a named host with direct `new(ExecutionMode::Run)` transitions when only `main`, runtime, or
/// error policy is custom. Use `App::<P>::builder(name).auto_discover()` directly when assembly must
/// capture local values, use plugin instances/options unavailable at item scope, or mutate the
/// builder outside declared callbacks. The direct builder does not generate the typestate host,
/// callbacks, CLI tree, static parser-visible plugin boundary, runner, or private tooling entry.
