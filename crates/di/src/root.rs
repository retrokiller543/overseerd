//! The framework-seeded [`RootResolver`] singleton: run-time access to the root container.
//!
//! Some framework singletons need to resolve components or extract dependencies from the
//! DI container *after* the app is built — a background scheduler firing job methods, a
//! task supervisor, and so on. They cannot inject a strong `Arc<ScopeContainer>` at
//! construction: the root container stores them, so a strong back-reference would be a
//! permanent reference cycle, and — like the container's own [`ComponentSource`] — the
//! self-handle only exists once the root is frozen.
//!
//! [`RootResolver`] is the general primitive for that. It is seeded as an ordinary
//! by-value injectable *before* the root is built (its slot empty) and [`attach`]ed to the
//! finished root afterwards, exactly as the [`HookManager`](overseerd_hooks::HookManager) is.
//! It holds only a [`Weak`] to the root, so it adds no cycle; a consumer upgrades it per
//! call. This lets any singleton reach the whole [`FromContainer`] surface at run time
//! without the container layer knowing what it is used for.
//!
//! [`attach`]: RootResolver::attach
//! [`ComponentSource`]: crate::container::ComponentSource
