//! DI-trait impls for [`PeerInfo`], behind the `di` feature.
//!
//! `PeerInfo` is a transport type the daemon seeds as a connection-scoped injectable. The
//! impls live here (PeerInfo's home crate) because the orphan rule forbids the daemon —
//! which owns neither `PeerInfo` nor the DI traits — from writing them.

use crate::PeerInfo;

/// The remote peer is a by-value connection-scoped injectable: a connection/request
/// component can depend on it directly as `peer: PeerInfo` — no `Arc`. Cheap to clone.
