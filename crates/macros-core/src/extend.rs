//! The macro extension seams.
//!
//! Overseerd's attribute macros are built as a **state machine** over an extension value. The
//! extension starts at [`Default`] and is driven through single-purpose phases, each mutating
//! its accumulated state; [`Expand::expand`] then reads that state. This lets `#[service]` be
//! `#[component]` + a router extension, and `#[handlers]` be `#[methods]` + an RPC extension,
//! with no forked parsers.
//!
//! The phases (each its own trait, so an extension implements only what it needs):
//!
//! 1. [`ParseKeyed`] — the macro-invocation keyed args (`#[m(key = value, ..)]`). The base arg
//!    type ([`ComponentArgs`](crate::ComponentArgs) / [`MethodArgs`](crate::MethodArgs)) parses
//!    its own common keys and hands every unknown key to the extension.
//! 2. [`ParseItem<T>`] — an optional first pass over the whole annotated item (the `ItemImpl`,
//!    or the struct/enum `DeriveInput`), to capture context (the type's name, …) or analyze it.
//! 3. [`ParseMethod`] — for impl macros, one pass per method, updating state and stripping the
//!    extension's marker attribute (e.g. `#[rpc]`).
//! 4. [`ToTokens`] — emit the accumulated contribution, appended after the base output. The
//!    earlier phases captured everything into the extension, so emission needs only `&self`,
//!    which is exactly what `ToTokens` provides. (This is also the "user-controlled control"
//!    seam: the base owns the skeleton and only splices the extension's tokens at a fixed
//!    point — the extension adds, it never rewrites.)
//!
//! [`NoExt`] is the single no-op default for every slot, so `ComponentArgs<NoExt>` is exactly
//! `#[component]` and `MethodArgs<NoExt>` is exactly `#[methods]`.
