//! STOMP's implementation of the protocol-generic messaging wire contract.
//!
//! The generic capability traits ([`MessagingProtocol`](crate::messaging::MessagingProtocol),
//! [`TopicCodec`](crate::messaging::TopicCodec), …) live in [`crate::messaging`] so they compile
//! behind `feature = "ws"` alone. This module holds the STOMP-specific wire pieces — the
//! [`StompBody`], the [`StompCodec`]/[`JsonCodec`], and STOMP's impls of the generic traits — behind
//! `feature = "stomp"`.
//!
//! The [`Stomp`] type itself lives here (not the server-only `ws` module) so a `#[topics(protocol =
//! Stomp)]` set and its generated client can name it on wasm; its server-only state is behind a
//! `cfg`, so on wasm it is a fieldless protocol tag. The stateful server behavior
//! (`WebsocketProtocol`, the broker serve loop) is implemented in [`crate::ws::stomp`]. The
//! server-only fan-out types ([`Publish`](crate::ws::stomp::Publish) /
//! [`StompOutcome`](crate::ws::stomp::StompOutcome)) also stay in that module.
